## Description
Square Root Sword is a game developed for the Global Game Jam 2023 under the theme "roots". You can play it here: https://junius7.itch.io/square-root-sword-v11

Our team decided to interpret it in the way of the mathematical operation and designed a turn-based combat game that places emphasis on the mathematical "square root".

## Gameplay mechanics
Players play the game by dragging the cards drawn each turn to the hero's sprite, and from there the player is able to choose to modify any number on the screen (health or attack damage) by dragging from the player's sprite to one of those numbers.

The modifying effect is determined by the card values and the operator on top of the player's sprite.

The enemy is defeated when their health is either zero or their health is square-rootable. However, the holy Square Root Sword is fair, so even the player's health when square-rootable becomes a wopping zero. The exception is the enemy's attack damage, which only becomes its square root when square rootable.

The players are then provided one of two upgrades when it defeats the enemy at each level, creating variety in gameplay.
